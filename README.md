# React Portfolio

## Description

This is my web developer portfolio coded as a single page application. It includes links to my work and resume, a contact form, and a short description of myself.

When you first load the portfolio you are presented with a navigation bar and an About Me page. You can also navigate to my portfolio, a contact form, and a resume page. The navbar highlights which page you are currently viewing. On the portfolio page, you will find several examples of my work including links to both deployed applications and github respositories. On the resume page you will find a list of my technical proficiencies and a link to download my resume. On the contact page you will find a contact form which includes some validation. At the bottom of the page you will find links to my github profile, my linkedin, and my work as a musician.
